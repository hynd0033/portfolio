Process -
I started this project by first collecting all images, fonts and studied the rubric to understand what I was doing.
Next, I began coding the html by following the mobile mockups. After all html was finished, I began using css to 
make the website appear like the mobile, tablet and desktop mockups. Bootstrap was implemented after the css.
I was trying to see what bootstrap could do and if the bootstrap kept the same design and goal, I removed the css. 
I finished the code by utlizing another framework, adding respoinsive images and accesbility.

Challenges - 
The biggest challenge I faced was trying to use bootstrap after finally becoming more familiar with css. 
Bootstrap is another language and I hadn't used it in a large project yet, only small and controlled assignments.
Another challenge was I made my mockup a little too difficult. The original mockup had too many changes on breaking points.
Multiple elements appearing and dissapearing, images becoming slideshows and page layout becoming drastically different. 
I had to do what I could and reduce some of the design to streamline it. The mockup also just didn't make sense even for a more experienced
coder.
